# Simple Banking System
This project is a simple C++ banking system simulation with transaction logging.
It includes:

* BankAccount class: supports deposit, withdraw, and transfer operations.

* Logger (Singleton pattern): logs all transactions with timestamps into a file (log.txt).

* Error handling: unsuccessful transactions (e.g., insufficient balance, invalid transfer) are also recorded.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate OOP concepts, file handling, and the Singleton design pattern in C++.
